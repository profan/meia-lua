meia-lua
----------------
A superset of Lua, made mostly for sake of experimentation.

Why?
--------
Ask not why, but why not!

I wanted to create a superset of Lua that contained some things I wanted to experiment with, like match expressions, destructuring, while still being 100% capable of ingesting normal Lua code, to make it as easy as possible to use in projects where I would normally use Lua, like working with LÃ–VE for example.

Whats different from Lua?
--------------------------------
Currently, nothing! :D

Version ``v0.1`` is intended to be a milestone where Lua ingested and put through the pipeline comes out as the same Lua on the other end, after which actual experimentation will resume.

What does it look like?
--------------------------------
Well, Lua; for now at least.
