meia-lua
----------------
A superset of Lua, made mostly for sake of experimentation.

Why?
--------
Ask not why, but why not!

I wanted to create a superset of Lua that contained some things I wanted to experiment with, like match expressions, destructuring, while still being 100% capable of ingesting normal Lua code, to make it as easy as possible to use in projects where I would normally use Lua, like working with LÃ–VE for example.

Another factor was the desire to write a nanopass compiler in **Racket**, inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os7FE3J-U5Q](Andy Keep's talk on writing a Nanopass Compiler), so.. here we are.

Whats different from Lua?
--------------------------------
Currently, nothing! :D

Version ``v0.1`` is intended to be a milestone where Lua ingested and put through the pipeline comes out as the same Lua on the other end, after which actual experimentation will resume.

What does it depend on?
--------------------------------
 * [http://racket-lang.org/](Racket)
   * [http://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/](brag)
   * [https://docs.racket-lang.org/nanopass/](nanopass)

What does it look like?
--------------------------------
Well, Lua; for now at least.
